                    <p>Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง 512 as amended by Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "Act"), IPMedia will terminate the account of any customer, or vendor who uses his or her privileges to unlawfully transmit copyrighted material without a license, valid defense or fair use privilege to do so. After proper notification by the copyright holder or its agent to the IPMedia and later confirmation through court order or an admission by the customer that an account has been an instrument of unlawful infringement, IPMedia will terminate the infringing customer's account. IPMedia may also in its sole discretion decide to terminate a customer's account privileges prior to that time if it has good belief that infringement has in fact occurred. In addition, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(c), IPMedia has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed infringements and for processing such claims in accordance with the Act. IPMedia respects the intellectual property of 
others and we ask other to do the same. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed through the website, please contact "Legal Department" at the mailing address:</p>

                                    <p>Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง 512 as amended by Title II of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "Act"), IPMedia will terminate the account of any customer, or vendor who uses his or her privileges to unlawfully transmit copyrighted material without a license, valid defense or fair use privilege to do so. After proper notification by the copyright holder or its agent to the IPMedia and later confirmation through court order or an admission by the customer that an account has been an instrument of unlawful infringement, IPMedia will terminate the infringing customer's account. IPMedia may also in its sole discretion decide to terminate a customer's account privileges prior to that time if it has good belief that infringement has in fact occurred. In addition, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(c), IPMedia has implemented procedures for receiving written notification of claimed infringements and for processing such claims in accordance with the Act. IPMedia respects the 
intellectual property of others and we ask other to do the same. If you believe that your copyright has been infringed through the website, please contact "Legal Department" at the mailing address:</p>
