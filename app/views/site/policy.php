                    <p>To address your concerns properly, we require your name, phone number, and e-mail address. We use this information solely to process your order and, if any questions should arise, to contact you about your order. In general, we will try to contact you first by e-mail and only if that fails, or if time is critical, will we try to contact you by phone. We process your orders ourselves, in house, and thus the sharing of this information is usually non-existent with any third parties. However, when we have to share this information, it will only be that information which is absolutely necessary, with those third parties that may be involved in the processing of your order in the future. For example, the financial institution that issued your credit card and the shipping carrier that delivers your order. Any sharing of personal information will be only with service providers (such as banks, credit card verifiers, etc.) in processing orders.</p>

                    <p>Should you decide to contact us through one of our e-mail addresses for a suggestion or problem via the Contact Us form, you will be supplying your name and e-mail address and we will only use that information to send you a prompt reply.</p>

In addition, we utilize the same encryption standard when transferring your credit card data to our internal fulfillment system.
